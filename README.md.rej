-Improed functionality: The user now logins with username instead of email; The users' name is displayed and welcomed in the profile page; The name of login_page.php is changed to index.php because the website needs a suitable home page and to load the page in the host. The user can create a task in profile.php and save it. The tasks are saved in database, which are created with the user's name.
